# What's this?
This is one of the many hardware-embedded software projects I've started and I've decided to make it public, since it's almost finished and some ideas may be useful for others too.

It is one of the most basic DIY projects, which is built by many hobbyists, a thermostat, based on the ESP8266 MCU and [esp-open-rtos](https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos/), a really nice FreeRTOS implementation for this microcrontoller.
